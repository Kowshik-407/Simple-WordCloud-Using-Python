		The development of the Town from slum city to a clean city, depends
 on the constitution of city Corporation. To improve the conditions in the
 Town , and make it a livable town, certain steps have to be taken without 
 further delay. The Town has to be constituted into the Corporation. It is 
 the only answer to the present problems of this town. There are many
 distinct advantages. It gives a certain amount of prestige and pride. 
 It is more autonomous. The distinct feature of the Corporation system is
 the statutory distribution of powers among the Council, Commisioner, and 
 the Standing Committees. The Council is a deliberative wing, and the 
 Commisioner is responsible for the executive responsibilities. 
 
 		Better qualified, and more suitable officers could be employed in
 the Corporation. Quality or civic services will be greatly improved. 
 The criterion laid down by the Rural Urban Relations Committee is that a 
 city should have a population of five lakhs, and more, and the annual 
 income should not be less than one crore. 
 
		The next important measure to be taken for immediate need for the 
 Town, is establishment of the city Development Authority or Corporation 
 this will be better than improvement Trust, or Town Planning Trust. It is 
 high time that the problems of a dynamic commercial and industrial centre 
 should be entrusted to the care of an appropriate Authority.  
  
		There is an urgent need to improve the conditions of living in the 
 existence city. The concept should be to make the city livable and comfort-
 -able. We have to establish certain minimum standards of comfort for the 
 urban population, that is, we should provide adequate water, drinage, 
 both underground and surface, and electricity to the households. 
 
		A careful survey has to be made, in respect of the various needs 
 of the city, and a time schedule drawn up, for implementing the schemes. 
 Seperate committees should watch the progress. A slum clearance board 
 must be set up for the town. This should be a part of the main Board 
 whenever a State Slum Clearance Board is established. To meet the fire 
 hazard, the fire engines should be located in different vulnerable parts 
 of this Conferring measure of fire protection is neccessary.
